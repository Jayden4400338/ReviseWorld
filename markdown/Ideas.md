## Idea Board

* Learning strategies/styles:
Things like PEEOP to help structure points easier or remember how to do certain things in a lesson.

* Teacher Dashboard - A dashboard for teachers to view the total amount of xp earned in their classroom, the amount earned per student, the mmount of hint tokens per student and overall in their classrom. Potentially the ability to give tokens to students as a reward (behavior in class etc) and student managment

* Admin Dashboard - A dashboard for me to view the overall amount of xp earned on the site, the overall amount of hint tokens earned on the site, total amount of users on the site, total amount of classrooms on the site and manage all users on the site. Also the ability to add content and word filters to the site so if a username is a certain word, the user will be forced to change it or it wont apply at all. 

* Teacher account checks -  Ensure that only teachers can make teacher accounts. Not thought of a way to do this yet but its something im definitely gonna do
