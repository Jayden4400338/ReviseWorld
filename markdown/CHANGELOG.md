# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being patient with students and learners of all levels
- Providing helpful and supportive feedback on contributions
- Respecting the educational purpose of this project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Sharing solutions to current exam papers or assessment materials
- Plagiarizing content or claiming others' work as your own

## Educational Integrity

As an educational platform, we hold ourselves to additional standards:

- **Accuracy**: All educational content must be factually accurate and properly sourced
- **Honesty**: Do not submit work that is not your own without proper attribution
- **Past Papers Only**: Only contribute questions from official past papers, not current or upcoming exams
- **Respect Copyright**: Follow fair use guidelines and properly attribute all sources
- **No Cheating**: This platform is for learning and revision, not for completing current assignments or exams

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
